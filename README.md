# The RegReg project

RegReg is a simple multi-algorithm Python framework for prototyping and solving regularized 
regression problems such as the LASSO. The goal is to enable practitioners to quickly and 
easily experiment with a variety of different models and choices of regularization. 
In that spirit, the emphasis is on the flexibility of the framework instead of computational 
speed for any particular problem, though the speed tradeoff will generally not be too bad.
