   BSD
      Berkeley software distribution license. The BSD_ license is
      permissive, in that it allows you to modify and use the code
      without requiring that you use the same license.  It allows
      you to distribute closed-source binaries.  


   GPL
      The GPL_ is the GNU general public license.  It is one of the
      most commonly-used open-source sofware licenses.  The
      distinctive feature of the GPL license is that it requires that
      any code derived from GPL code also uses a GPL license.  It also
      requires that any code that is statically or dynamically linked
      to GPL code has a GPL-compatible license. See:
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License and
      http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html

   LGPL
      The lesser GNU public license.  LGPL_ differs from the
      :term:`GPL` in that you can link to LGPL code from non-LGPL code
      without having to adopt a GPL-compatible license.  However, if
      you modify the code (create a "derivative work"), that
      modification has to be released under the LGPL. See `wikipedia
      LGPL
      <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License>`_
      for more discussion.

   Matlab
      matlab_ began as a high-level programming language for working with
      matrices.  Over time it has expanded to become a fairly general-purpose
      language.  See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATLAB.  It has good
      numerical algorithms, 2D graphics, and documentation.  There are several
      large neuroscience software projects wtitten in matlab, including
      :term:`SPM software`.
