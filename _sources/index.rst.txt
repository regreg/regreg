.. _about_regreg:

==================
The RegReg project
==================

RegReg is a proximal gradient algorithm Python framework for prototyping and
solving regularized regression problems such as the LASSO. The goal is to
enable practitioners to quickly and easily experiment with a variety of
different models and choices of regularization. In that spirit, the emphasis
is on the flexibility of the framework instead of computational speed for any
particular problem.

For more details, see the :ref:`algorithms` page.

If you are interested in contributing as a developer, please see the :ref:`agenda` page.
